# CV App

CV App created using Javascript, React and TailwindCSS, React-PDF library and React-Icons Library

It allows you to create your own CV with multiple dynamic options and images included. It also creates and exports to PDF. This was my first "real" ReactJS project so it's probably a little bit spaghetti code as I learned as I went along.
